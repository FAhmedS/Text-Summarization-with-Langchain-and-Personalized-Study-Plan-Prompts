**Text Summarization with Langchain and Personalized Study Plan Prompts**

This repository explores two key natural language processing (NLP) tasks:

1. **Text Summarization using Langchain and Hugging Face:**
   - Implements text summarization using Langchain, a high-level library for building and training NLP pipelines.
   - Leverages the power of Hugging Face transformers, pre-trained models for various NLP tasks, for effective summarization.
   - Finally, using langchain evaluation metrics e.g. Coherence, relevance to evalute summarized output with original text. 

2. **Comprehensively Tailored Prompts for Personalized Study Plans:**
   - Provides meticulously designed prompts to guide AI assistants in creating personalized study plans for students.
   - Takes into account diverse student data points:
     - Subjects and academic performance
     - Preferred learning styles (visual, auditory, kinesthetic)
     - Extracurricular activities
     - Personal objectives and challenges
   - Aims to generate effective study plans that cater to individual student needs and learning preferences.

**Future Directions:**

- Potential areas for further exploration include:
   - Experimenting with different summarization techniques and models
   - Implementing additional NLP tasks beyond text summarization
   - Refining the personalized study plan prompts based on user feedback and testing

**Getting Started**
